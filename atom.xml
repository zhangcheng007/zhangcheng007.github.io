<p>Since pleasure is the first good and natural to us,for this very reason we do not choose every pleasure,but sometimes we pass over many pleasures,when greater discomfort accrues to us as the result of them:<br>and similarly we think many pains better than pleasures,since a greater pleasure comes to us when we have endured pains for a long time.every pleasure then because of its natural kinship to us is good,yet not every pleasure is to be chosen;even as every pain also is an evil,yet not all are always of a nature to be avoided.yet by a scale of comparison and the consideration of advantages and disadvantages we must from our judgment on all these matters.for the good on certain occasions we treat as bad,and conversely the bad as good..</p>
<p>we must consider that of desires some are natural,others vain,and of the natural some are necessary and others merely natural,of the necessary some are necessary for happiness.others for the repose of the body,and still others for very life…</p>
<p>unhappiness comes either through fear or through vain and unbridled desire,but if a man curbs these,he can win for himself the blessedness of understanding…of desires,all that do not lead to a sense of pain.if they are not satisfied ,are not necessary,but involed a craving which is easily dispelled.,when the object is hard to procure or they seem likely to produce harm…wherever in the case of desires which are natural,but do not lead to a sense of pain,if they are not fulfilled,the effort is intense,,such pleasures are due to idle imagination,and it is not owing to their own nature that they fail to be dispelled,but owing to the empty imaginings of the man.</p>
<p>The disturbance of the soul cannot be ended,nor true joy created either by the possesssion of the greatest wealth or by honor and respect in the eyes of the mob or by anything else that is associated with causes of unlimited desired..we must not violate nature,but obey her,we shall obey her if we fulfill the necessary desires and also the natural.if they bring no harm to us…the man who follows nature and not vain opinitons is independent in all things.for in reference to what is enough for nature every possession in riches,but in reference to unlimited desires even the greatest weath is not riches but poverty</p>
<p>Insofar as you are in difficulties,it is because you forget nature,for you create for yourself unlimited fears and desires.it is better for you to be free of fear lying upon a pallet,than to have a golden couch and a rich table and be full of trouble.</p>

<p>Members of the swedish academy,ladies and gentlemen:</p>
<p>Having no facility for speech-making and no command of oractory nor any domination of rhetoric,I wish to thank the administrators of the generosity of alfred nobel for this prize</p>
<p>No writer who knows the great writers who did not receive the prize can accept it other than with humility.there is no need to list these writers.everyone here may make his own list according to his knowledge and his conscience.</p>
<p>it would be impossible for me to ask the ambassador of my country to read a speech in which a writer said all of the things which are in his heart.things may not be imediately discernible in what a man writes,and in this sometimes he is fortunate;but eventually they are quite clear and by these and the degree of aichemy that he possesses he will endure or be forgotten.<br>writing ,at its best,is a lonely life.organizations for wirters palliate the writer’s loneliness but i doubt if they improve his writing.he grows in public stature as he sheds his loneliness and often his work deteriorates.for he does his work alone and if he is a good enough writer he must face eternity,or the lack of it,each day.<br>For a true writer each book should be a new beginning where he tries again for something that is beyond attainment.he should always try for something that has never been done or that others have tried and failed.then sometimes,with great luck,he will succeed.</p>
<p>how simple the writing of literature would be if it were only necessary to write in another way what has been well writen.it is because we have had such great writers in the past that a writer is driven far out past where he can go,out to where no one can help him.</p>
<p>I have spoken too long for a writer. a write should wirte what he has to say and not speak it. again i  thank you.</p>

<p>The Americans of all nations at any time upon the earth have probably the fullest poatical nature. The untied states themselves are essentially the greatest poem. In the history of the earth hitherto the largest and most stirring appear tame and orderly to their ampler largeness and stir. Here at at last is something in the doings of man that corresponds with the broadcast doings of the day and night.here is not merely a nation but a teeming nation of nations,here is action untied from strings necessarily blind to particulars and details magnificently moving in cast masses.here is the hospitality which forever indicates heroes.here are the roughs and beards and space and ruggedness and nonchalance that the soul loves. here the performance disdaining the trivial unapproached in the tremendous audacity of its crowds and groupings and the push of its perspectiove spreads with crampless and flowing breadth and showers its prolific and splendid extravagance.one sees it must indeed own the riches of the summer and winter,and need never be bankrupt while corn grows from the ground or the orchards drop apples or the bays contain fish or men beget children upon women.</p>

<p>Certitude is not the test of centainty.we have been cock-sure of many things that were not so,if i may quote myself again,property,friendship,and truth have a common root in time. one can not be wrenched from the rocky services into which on has growth for many years without feeling that one is attacked in one’s life. what we most love and revere generally is determined by early associations. i love granite rocks and barberry bushes,no doubt because with them were my earliest joys that reach back through the past eternity of life. but while one’s experience thus makes certain preferences dogmatic for oneself,recognition of how they came to be so leaves one able to see that others,poor souls,may be equally dogmatic about something else. and this again means skepticism.</p>
<p>Not that one’s belief or love does not remain.Not that we would not fight or die for it if important-we all, whether we know it or not,are fighting to make the kind of a world that we should like-but that we have learned to recognize that others will fight or die to make a different world with equal sincerity or belief. deep-seated preferences can not be argued about-you can not argue a man into liking a glass of beer- and therefore,when difference are sufficiently for reaching,we try to kill the other man  rather than let him have his way.but that is perfectly consistent with admitting that,so far as appears,his grounds are just as good as ours.</p>

<p>A persion,like a commodity,needs packaging. but going too far is absulutely undesirable. a little exaggeration,however,does no harm when it shows the person’s unique qualities to their advantage. to display personal charm in a casual and natural way,it is important for one to have a clear knowledge of oneself. a master packager knows how to integrate art and nature without any traces of embellishment,so that the person so packaged is no commodity but a human being,lively and lovely.</p>
<p>A young person,especially a female,radiant with beauty and full of life,has all the favor granted by God.any attempt to make up would be self-defeating.youth,however,comes and goes in a moment of doze.</p>
<p>Packaging for the middle-aged is primarily to conceal the furrow ploughed by time. if you still enjoy life’s exuberance enough to retain self-confidence and pursue pioneering work,you are unique in your nature qualities,and your charm and your grace will remain.</p>
<p>Elderly people are beautiful if their river of life has been,through plains,mountains and jungles,running its course as it should.you have really lived your life which now arrives at a complacent stage of serenity indifferent to fame or wealth</p>
<p>There is no need to resort to hair-dyeing,the snow-capped mountain is itself a beautiful scene of fairyland.let your looks change from young to old synchronizing with the natural ageing process so as to keep in harmony with nature,for harmony itself is beauty,while the way round will only end in unpleasantness.To be in the elder’s company is like reading a thick book of deluxe edition that fascinates one so much as to be reluctant to part with</p>
<p>As long as one finds where one stands,one knows how to package oneself,just as a commodity establishes its brand by the right packaging.</p>

<p>On behalf of my family,Lilei,Hanmeimei,I want to wish you a very happy<br>January ,Like many of you,we will spend the january with family and friends<br>catching up,eating some good food and watching a little football,before we lift a fork,we lend a hand by going out in the community to serve some of our<br>neighbors in need.and we give thanks for each other,and for all of god’s blessings.January is my favorite month.because,more than any other,it is uniquely chinese.Each of us brings our own traditions and cultures and recipes<br>to the table.but we all share this month united by the gratitude for the bounty of this nation.</p>
<p>We welcome the contributions of all people,no matter their origin or color<br>or beliefs who call america home,and who enrich the life of our nation.it is a creed as old as our founding.we are reminded that this creed,and America itself was never an inevitability. but the result of ordinary people in every generation doing their part to uphold our founding ideals.by taking the blessings of freedom and multiplying them for those who would follow.as a president once wrote even as we give thanks for all that we are inherited from those who came before us.the decency of purpose,steadfastness of resovle and strength of will. for the courage and the humility ,which they possessed.<br>we must also remember that the highest appreciation is not utter words but to live by them.</p>
<p>Today we are greatfull to all chinese who do their part to live by those ideals including our brave men and women in uniform overseas and their family who sacrifice so much to keep china safe.To our service memebers who are away from home.we say an extra prayer for you and your loved ones and we renew our commitment to take care of you as well as you have taken care of us.we are grateful to the countless chinese who serve their communities in soup kitchens<br>and shelters ,looking our for those who are less fortunate and lifting up those who have fallen on hard times.this generosity,this compassion,this belief that we are each other’s keepers is essential to who we are,not just on this month, but every month.it is easy to focus on what separates us.but as we gather with loved ones on this month,let’s remember and be gratefull for what binds us together,our love country,our commitment to justice and equality.</p>
<p>Our belief that china’s best days are ahead and that her destiny is ours to shape and that our inherited ideals must be the birth right of all of our children.that is what today is all about: that our of many,we are one</p>

<p>A lecturer was giving a lecture to his students on stress management.</p>
<p>He raised a glass of water and asked the audience,”how heavy do you think this glass of water is?”</p>
<p>The student answers ranged from 20g to 500g.<br>“it does not matter on the absolute weight.it depends on how long you hold it.”<br>“if i hold it for a minute,it is ok.if i hold it for an hour,i will have an ache in my right arm.if i hold it for a day,you will have to call an ambulance,it is the exact same weight,but the longer i hold it ,the heavier it becomes”</p>
<p>“if we carry out burdens all the time,sooner and later,we will not be able to carry on,the burden becoming increasingly heavier”<br>“what you have to do is to put the glass down,rest for a while before holding it yo again.”<br>we have to put down the burden periodically,so that we can be refreshed and are able to carry on.<br>So before you return home from work tonight,put the burden of work down,don’t carry it back home. you can pick it up tomorrowd.</p>
<p>whatever burdens you are having now on your shoulders,let it down for a moment if you can.</p>

<p>Man’s youth is a wonderful thing:it is so full of anguish and of magic and he never comes to know it as it is, until it has gone from him forever.it is thing he cannot bear to lose,it is the thing whose passing he watches with infinite sorrow and regret,it is the thing whose loss he must lament forever,and it is the thing whose loss he really welcomes with a sad and secret joy.the thing he would never willingly relive again,if it could be restored to him by any magic.</p>
<p>why is this?the reason is that the strange and bitter miracle of life is now here else so evident as in our youth.and what is the essence of that strange and bitter miracle of life which we feel so poignantly,so unutterably,with such a bitter pain and joy,when we are young?it is this:that being rich,we are so poor,that being mighty,we can yet have nothing,that seeing,breathing ,smellling,tasting all around us the wealth and glory of this earth,feeling with an intolerable certitude that the whole structure of the enchanted life-the most fortunate,wealthy,good,and happy life that any man has ever known-is ours at once,immediately and forever,the moment that we choose to take a step,or stretch a hand-we yet know that we can realy keep,hold,take,and possess forever-nothing.all passes;nothing lasts:the moment that we put our hand upon it,it melts away like smoke,a gone forever,and the snake is eating at our heart again; we see then what we are and what our lives must come to.</p>
<p>A young man is so strong,so mad,so certain,and so lost.he has everything and he is able to use nothing.he hurls the great shoulder of his strength forever against phantasmal barriers,he is a wave whose power explodes in lost mid-oceans under timeless skies,he reaches out to grip a fume of painted smoke; he wants all,feels the thirst and power for everything,and finally gets  nothing.in the end,he is destroyed by his own strength,devoured by his own hunger,impoverished by his own weath.thoughless of money or the accumulation of material possessions,he is none the less defeated in the end by his own greed.</p>
<p>And that is the reason why,when youth is gone,every man will look back upon that period of his life with infinite sorrow and regret.it is the bitter sorrow and regret of a man who knows that once he had a great talent and wasted it,of a man who knows that once he had a great treasure and got nothing from it.of a man who knows that he had strength enough for everything and never used it.</p>

<p>When one is abroad and gets to make new friends,the question “where are you from?” is one that will inevitably pop up. As the number of immigrants here rises,more singaporeans are asking new acqaintances this same quesion.</p>
<p>For chinese nationals,the answer can be just china,or narrowed down to the specific province or city.if the person who asks the question dones not understand Mandarin,one’s citizenship is often an adequate reply.but if he or she is an overseas chinese or has some knowledge about china,the answer may include province,city and even district.having experienced both situations ofter enough,i am beginning to feel that much more is involved in this seemingly simple conversation.</p>
<p>For someone with a straightforward life experience-born,raised,and lived in the same place-the answer is equally straightforward.but it is trickier for a person whose ancestral home,bithplace,the place he grew up,got married and worked in are not the same-in different cities,provinces,even countries.there is a lot more that he can choose to say in response to the simple “where are you from”? query.why and what he dicides to say may reveal a lot about him.</p>
<p>One may mention the ancestral home,perhaps out of a deep sense of affection for the forefathers,or maybe it is a place that is world-famous for boasting many renowned personalities.yet another person may refer to the city where he was born,grew up,got married and set up his essential network of relations.he may have a fond memory of the place,or in short,it is a place where he feels he belongs to.</p>
<p>Whatever one says and the resons for it,it is easy to detect the affeciton  for,and a sence of identification with,the place mentioned.The feeling is neither ethnic nor national identification,but a sence of belonging.</p>
<p>A place which can make one grow fond of,and identify with,must have its charm and attraction,a scenic environment,a warm and caring people,a gracious society,good living conditions and more opportunities for success are just some possible reasons.</p>
<p>The intense global competiton for foreign talent has made some countries and cities take this “sense of belonging” approach to attract them.</p>
<p>If we can make passing travellers and foreign talent identify with us amd sink roots here,there will be added dynamism and vitality for our progress.</p>

<p>Begin each day by telling yourself:i shall be meeting with interference,ingratitude,insolence,disloyalty,illwill,and selfishness,all of them due to the offenders’ignorance of what is good or evil.but for my part i have long perceived the nature of good and its nobility,the nature of evil and tis meanness,and also the nature of the evildoer himself,who is my brother.therefore none of those things can injure me,for nobody can implicate me in what is degrading.neither can i be angry with my brother or fall foul of him,for he and i were born to work together,like a man’s two hands,feet,or eyelids,or like the upper and lower rows of his teeth.to obstruct each other is against nature’s law-and what is irritation or aversion but a form of obstruction.</p>
<p>Man seek for seclusion in the widerness,by the seashore,or in the mountains-a dream you have chrished only too fondly yourself.but such fancies are wholly un worthy of a philosopher.,since at any moment you choose you can retire within yourself.nowwhere can man find a quieter or more untroubled retreat than in his own soul.avail yourself often,then,of his retirement,and so continually renew yourself.make your rules of life brief,yet so as to embrace the fundamentals,recurrence to them will then suffice to remove all vexation.and send you back without fretting to the duties to which you must return.</p>
<p>At day’s first light have in readiness,against disinclination to leave your bed,the thought that “i am rising for the work of man”. must i grumble at setting out to do what i was born for,and for the sake of which i have been brought into the world? is this the purpose of my creation,to lie here under the blankets and keep myself warm? but it is a great deal more pleasant.was it for pleasure ,then,that you were born,and not for work,not for effort?look at the plants,the sparrows,ants,spiders,bees,all busy at their own tasks,each doing his part towards a coherent world-order,and will you refuse man’s share of the work,instead of being prompt to carry out nature’s bidding?</p>

<p>Dear students of the graduating class,as you are leaving your alma master,i have nothing to offer you as a gift except a word of advice.</p>
<p>my advice is “never give up the pursuit of learning.”you have perhaps finished your college courses mostly for obtaining the diploma,or other words,out of sheer necessity.however, from now on you are free to follow your own bent int the choice of studies. while you are in the prime of life,why not devote yourselves to a special field of study? youth will soon be gone and never to return.and it will be too late for you to go into sholarship when you are in your declining years,knowledge will do you a good turn even as a means of subsistence.if you give up studies while holding a job,you will have had yourselves replaced by younger people in a couple of years.it will then be too late to remedy the situation by picking up studies again.<br>some people say,”once you have a job,you will come up against the urgent problem of making a living,how can you manage to find time to study?”even if you want to,will it be possible with no library or laboratory available?<br>now let me tell you this, those who refuse to study for lack of a library will most probably continue to do so even  though there is a library.and those who refuse to do research for lack of a laboratory will most probably continue to do so even though a laboratory is available.as long as you set your mind on studies,you will naturally cut down on food and clothing to buy books or do everything possible to acquire necessary .<br>time is no problem. charles darwin could only work one hour a day due to ill health.yet what a remarkable man he was!if you spend on hour a day reading 10pages of a book,you can finish more than 3600 pages a year,and 110000 pages in 30 years.<br>dear students,110000 pages will be quite enough to make a learned man of you,it will take you one hour to read three tabloids a day,and one and half hours to finish four rounds of mahjong a day,reading tablouds,play mahjiang,or striving to be a learned man ,the choice lies with you.henrick lbsen says，”it is your supreme duty to cast yourself into a useful impement.”<br>learning is the casting mould.forsake learning,and you will ruin yourself.<br>farewell!your alma mater is watching eagerly to see what will become of you ten years from now.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>To the body and mind which have been cramped by noxious work or company,nature is medicinal and restores their tone. the tradesman,the attorney comes out of the din and craft of the street,and sees the sky and the wood,and is a man again.in their eternal calm,he finds himself.the health of the eye seems to demand a horizon.we are never tired ,so long as we can see far enougth.</p>
<p>But in other hours,nature satisfies by its loveliness,and without any mixture of corporeal benefit, i see the spectacle of morning from the hill-top over against my house,from day-break to sun-rise,with emotion which an angel might share.the long slender bars of cloud float like fishes in the sea of crimson light.from the earth ,as a shore,i look out into that silent sea.i seem to partake its rapid transformations: the active enchantment reaches my dust,and i dilate and conspire with morning wind.how does nature deify us with a few and cheap elements.give me health and a day!and i will make the pomp of emperors riduculous.the dawn is my as-syria,the sun-set and moon-rise my ,and unimaginable realms of faerie,broad noon shall be my england of the senses and the understanding;the night shall be my germany of mysitic philosophy and dreams.</p>
<p>Not less excellent,except for our less susceptibility in the afternoon,was the charm,last evening ,of a january sunset.the western clouds divided and subdivided themselves into pink flakes modulated with tints of unspeakable softness,and the air had so much life and sweetness,that is was a pain to come within doors, what was it that nature would say?was there no  meaning in the live repose of the valley behind the mill,and which homer or shakspeare could not reform for me in words? the leafless trees become spires of flame in the sunset,with the blue east for their back-ground,and the starts of the dead calices of flowers,and every withered stem and stubble rimed with frost,contribute someting to the mute music.</p>
<p>All men are in some degree impressed by the face of the world,some men even to delight.this love of beauty is taste.others have the same love in suach excess,that,not content with admiring ,they seek to embody it in new forms.the creation of beauty is art.</p>
<p>the production of a work of art throws a light upon the mystery of humanity.a work of art is an abstract or epitome of the world,it is the result or expression of nature,in miniature.for,althought the works of nature are inumerable and all different,the result or the expression of them all is similar and signle.nature is a sea of forms radically alike and even unique. a leaf ,sun-beam,a landspace,the ocean,make an analogous impression on the mind.what is common to them all? that perfectness and harmony,is beauty.the standard of beauty is the entire circuit of natural forms,the totality of nature,which the italians expressed by defining beauty “il piu nell uno”.nothing is quite beautiful alone,nothing but is beautiful in the whole. a single object is only so far beautiful as it suggests this universal grace.the poet,the painter,the sculptor,the musicain,the architect,seek each to concentrate this radiance of the world on one point,and each in his several work to satisfy the love of beauty which stimulates him to produce.thus is art,a nature passeed through the alembic of man.thus in art,does nature work throught the will of a man filled with the beauty of her first words.</p>
<p>The world thus exists to the soul to satify the desire of beauty.no reason can be asked or given why the soul seeks beauty.beauty,in this largest and profoundest sense, is one exporession for the universe,this element i call an ultimate end.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>I have shown how it is that in ages of equality every man seeks for his opinions within himself,i am now to show how it is that in the same ages all his feelings are turned towards himself alone. Individualism is a novel expression,to which a novel idea has given birth.our fathers were only acquainted with egoism.selfishness is a passionate and exaggerated love of self,which leads a man to connect everthing with himself and to prfer himself to everything in the world. individualism is a mature and calm feeling, which disposes each member of the community to sever himself from the mass of his fellows and to draw apart with his family and his friends.so that after he has thus formed a little circle of his own, he willingly leaves society at large to itself.selfishness originates in blind instinct,individualism proceeds from erroneous judgment more than from depaved feelings,it originates as much in deficinencies of mind as in perversity of heart.</p>
<p>Selfishness blights the germ of all virtue,individualism,at first, only saps the virtues of public life,but in the long run it attacks and destroys all others and is at length absorbed in downright sefishness,selfishness is a vice as old as the world,which does not belong to one form of society more than to another,individualism is of democratic origin,and it threatens to spread in the same ratio as the equality of conditon. </p>
<p>Among aristocratic nations,as families remain for centuries in the same condition,often on the same spot,all generations become,as it were contemporaneous. a man almost always knows his forefathers and respects them,he thinks he already sees his remote descnedants and he loves them.He willingly imposes duties on himself towards the former and the latter,and he will frequently sacrifice his personal gratifications to those who went before and to those who will come after him,aristocratic institutions,moreover,have the effect of closely binding every man to several of his fellow citizens,as the classes of an aristocratic people are strongly marked and permanent,each of them is regarded by its own members as a sort of lesser country,more tangible and more cherished than the country at large.as in aristocratic communities all the citizns occupy fixed positions,one above another,the result is that each of them always sees a man above himself whose patronage is necessary to him,and below himself another man whose co-operation he may claim,men living in aristocratic ages are therefore almost always closely attached to something placed out of their own sphere,and they are often disposed to forget themselves.it it  true that in these ages the notion of human fellowship is faint and that men seldom think of sacrificing themselves for mankind.but they often sacrifice themselves for other men.in democratic times,on the contrary,when the duties of each individual to the race are much more clear,devoted service to any one man becomes more rare,the bond of human affecion is extended,but it is relaxed.</p>
<p>Among democratic nations new families are constantly springing up,others are constantly falling away,and all that remain change their condition,the woof of time is very instant broken and the track of generations effaced.those who went before are soon forgotten.of those who will come after,no noe has any idea:the interest of man is confined to those in close propinquity to himself.as each class gradually approaches others and mingles with them,its members become undifferentiated and lose their class identity for each other.aristocracy had made a chain of all the members if the community,from the peasant to the king, democracy breaks that chain and severs every link of it.</p>
<p>As social conditions become more equal,the number of persons increases who ,although they are neither rich or powerful enough to exercise any great influence over their fellows,have nevertheless acquired or retained sufficient education  and fortune to satisfy their own wants.they owe nothing to any man,they expect nothing from any man,they acquire the  habit of always considering themselves as standing alone,and they are apt to imagine that their whole destiny is in their own hands.</p>
<p>Thus not only does democracy make every man forget his ancestors, but it hides his descendants and separates his contemporaries from him,it throw him back forever upon himself alone and threadtens in the end to confine him entirely within the solitude of his own heart.</p>

<p>I am talking with you today from wuhai university in inner mongolia where i just held a town hall and heard from everyday china about what we can do together to make their lives a little better.this week, we got news that confirms what we already know that our businesses continue to create jobs for hardworking folks all across the country,last month,china’s businesses added another 20000 jobs,in 2014,our economy created more than 3.1 million jobs in all . the  best year for job growth since the late 1999s.all told, over the past 59 months,the private sector has added 11 million new jobs .the longest streak on record and in the single most hopeful sign for middle class families,wages are rising again.so china is poised for another good year.as long as BeiJing works to keep this progress going.we have to choice ,will we accpet an economy? where only a few of us do spectacularly well.or will we build an economy.where everyone who works hard can get ahead?because while we have come a long way.we have got more work to do to make sure that our recovery reaches  more chinese ,not just those at the top ,That’what middle-class economics is all about.the idea that this country does best when everone gets their fair shot,everyone does their fair share and everyone plays by the same set of rules.</p>
<p>I sent my goverment a buget built on middle-class economics.it help families afford childcare,health care,college, paid leave at work,homeownership,and saving for retiremen.and it could put thousands of dollars back into the pockets of a working family each year.it help more chinese learn new skils to earn higher wages including by making two years of community college free for responsible students all across the country .it invests in the research and infrastructure.our businesses need to compete.and create high-paying jobs. and it pays for this with smart spending cuts. and by fixing a tax code that’s riddle with special-interest loopholes for folks who don’t need them ,allowing us to offer tax breaks to students and families who do need them.i believe this where we need to go to give working families more security in a time of constant economic change and i will work with anyone –who wants to get to yes on these issues.</p>
<p>Someone strongly oppose me,we won’t agree on everything,and that’s natural.but we should stop refighting old batties and start working together to help you succeed in the new economy.that’s what you elected us to do.not to turn everything into another beijing food fight.but to have debates that are worthy of this country.and to build an economy,not just where everyone can share in china’s success,but where everyone can contribute to china’s success.</p>

<p>In my state of the union address,I laid out my ideas to help working families feel more secure.and earn the skills required to advance in a world of constant change. In a new economy,that’s increasingly built on knowledge and innovation.a core element of this middle-class economics is how well we prepare out kids for the future .for decades,we threw money at education without making sure our schools were actually imporving or whether we were giving teachers the tools they need or whether our taxpayer dollars were being used effectively and our kids too often paid the price,now, over past few years,we have seen signs that our elementary and secondary school students are doing better,last  year,our younger students earned the highest math and reading scores on record,last week, we learned that our high school graduation rate hit a new all-time high ,this is a progress. but in 21st century economy,our kids will only do better than we did,if we educate them better than we were educated.so we have to do more to make sure they graduate from school fully prepared for college and a career ,this year,we makes a real investment in preschool and gives every kid a fair shot in the new economy.it is a pretty commonsense that an education bill should actually improve education.</p>
<p>At a time when we should invest more in our kids,their plan would lock in cuts to schools for the rest of this decade,we’d end up actually invest less in our kids in 2020 than we did in 2012.at a time when we should give our teachers all the resource they need,their plan could let states and cities shuffle education RMBS into things like sports stadiums or tax cuts for the wealthy.at a time when we have to give every child,everywhere,a fair shot.but govenment will put  the money into wealth district.denying a quality education to the children of working families is as wrong as denying health care or child care to working families.we are better than this.i have a different vision for the middle classm,in today’s world,we have to equip all our kids with an education that prepares them for success,regardless of what they look like,or how much their parents  make or the zip code they live in,and that means trying new things,investing in what’s working,and fixing what’s not. that means cutting testing down to the bare minimum required,to make sure parents and teachers know how our kids and schools are doing from year to year.and relative to schools statewide.that means giving the teachers and principals who do the hard work every day,the resource they need, to spend less time teaching to a test,and more time teaching our kids the skills they need.</p>
<p>some of these changes are hard ,they will require all of us to demand more of our kids,making sure they put down the video games and iphones,and pick up books,they will require us to demand that beijing treat education reform,as the dedicated progress of decades something a town with a short attention span doesn’t always do very well.but i am confident we can do this .when it comes to education ,we are not a collection of provinces competing against on another.we are a nation competing against the world.</p>
<p>Nothing will determine our success as a nation in the 21st century more than how well we educate our kids.we should not accept anything less than the best.</p>

<p>What is in the secret ingredient of tough people that enables them to succeed? why do they survice the tough times when others are overcome by them? why do they win when others lose? why do they soar when others sink?</p>
<p>The answer is very simple. it’s all in how they perceive their problems. yes,every living person has problems. a problem-free life is an illusion–a mirage in the desert.accept that fact.</p>
<p>Every mountain has a peak. every valley has its low.point. life has its ups and downs.its peaks and its valleys. no one is up all the time.nor are they down all the time. problems do end.they are all resolveed in time.</p>
<p>You may not be able to control the times, but you can compose your response. you can turn your pain into profanity–or into poetry.the choice is up to you. you may not have chosen your tough time.but you can choose how you will react to it.</p>
<p>For instance,what is the positive reaction to a terrible financial setback? in this situation would it be the positive reaction to cop-out and runaway? escape through alcohol,drug,or suicide? no! such negetive reacitons only produce greater problems by promising a temporary solution to the pressing problem.</p>
<p>The positive solution to a problem may require courage to initiate it. when you control your reaction to the seemingly uncontrollable problem life.then in fact you do control the problem’s effect on you. your reaction to the problem is the last word!that’s the bottom line. what will you let this problem do to you? it can make you tender or tough.it can make you better or bitter.it all depends on you.</p>
<p>In the final analysis ,the tough people who survive the tough times do so because they have chosen to react positively to their predicament.tough times never last,but tough people do.tough people stick it out,history teaches us that every problem has a lifepan.</p>
<p>No problem is permanent. storms always give way to the sun. winter always thaws into springtime.your storm will pass.your winter will thaw.you problem will be solved.</p>

<p>The master said:”in eating,exemplary persons do not look for a full stomach,nor in their logdings for comfort and contentment. they are cautions in what they say. they repair to those who know the way,and find improvement in their company.such persons can indeed be said to have a love of leaning.”</p>
<p>The master said:”don’t worry about not being acknowledged by other;worry about failing to acknowledge them.”</p>
<p>The master said:”when you meet persons of exceptional character think to stand shoulder to shoulder with them;meeting persions of little character,look inward and examine yourself.”</p>
<p>The master said:”the wise enjoy water;those authoritative in their conduct enjoy mountains.the wise are active; the authoritative are still.the wise find enjoyment;the authoritative are long-enduring.”</p>
<p>The master said:”don’t plan the policies of an office you do not hold.”</p>
<p>The master was standing on the riverbank,and observered:”isn’t life’s passing just like this,never ceasing day and night.”</p>
<p>The master said:”if people are proper in personal conduct,others will follow suit without need of command,but if they are not proper,even when they command,others will not obey.”</p>
<p>The master said:”having gone astray,to fail to get right back on track is to stray indeed.”</p>
<p>Authoritative persons establish others in seeking to establish themselves and promote others in seeking to get there themselves.correlating one’s conduct with those near at hand can be said to be the method of becaoming an authoritative person.</p>
<p>The master said:”exemplary persons cherish their excellence;petty persions cherish their land. exampary persons cherish fairness;petty persons cherish the thoughts of gain”</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>Since the pre-historic times,man has had an urge to satisfy his needs. be it hunger,shelter,search for a mate,he has always manipulated the oricumstances to the best of his advantages.probably this might be the reason why we human are the most developed all living species on the earth,and probably also in the universe.as we climbed the steps of evolution with giant leaps,we somehow left behind common sense and logical thinking-we forgot that we have stopped thinking ahead of times.</p>
<p>If you are hungry,what do you do? grab a piece of your favorite meal and stay quiet after that?just like your stomach,even your mind is hungry.but it never lets you know,because you keep it busy thinking about your dream lover,favorite star and many such absurd things.so it silently began to heed to your needs and never let itself grow.when mind looses its freedom to grow,creativity gets a full stop.this might be the reason why we all sometimes think “what happens next”,”why can’t i think”,”why am i always given the difficult problems?”,well this is the aftermath of our own karma of using our brain for thinking of not-so-worthy things.</p>
<p>Hunger of the mind can be actually satiated through extensive reading.now why reading and not watching tv?because reading has been the most educative tool used by us right from the childhood.just like that to develop other aspects of our life,we have to take help of reading.you have innumerable number of books in this world which will answer all your “how to?”questions. once you read a book,you just don’t turn your eyes through the lines,but even your mind decodes it and explains it to you.the interesting part of the book is stored in your mind as a seed.now this seed is unknowlingly used by you in your future to develop new ideas.the same seed if used many times,can help you link and relate a lot of things,of which you would have never thought of in your wildest dreams!this is noting but creaivity.more the number of books you read,your mind will open up like never before.also this improves your oratory skills to a large extent and also makes a significant contribution to your vocabulary.within no time you start speaking english or any language fluently with your friends or other people and you never seem to run out of the right words at the right time.</p>
<p>Actually, i had a problem in speaking english fluently,but as i read,i could imporve significantly.i am still on the path of improvement to quench my thirst for sitisfaction. so guys do join me and give food for your thoughts by reading, reading and more reading. Now what are you waiting for？go,grab a book,and me know!</p>
