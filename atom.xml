    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>To the body and mind which have been cramped by noxious work or company,nature is medicinal and restores their tone. the tradesman,the attorney comes out of the din and craft of the street,and sees the sky and the wood,and is a man again.in their eternal calm,he finds himself.the health of the eye seems to demand a horizon.we are never tired ,so long as we can see far enougth.</p>
<p>But in other hours,nature satisfies by its loveliness,and without any mixture of corporeal benefit, i see the spectacle of morning from the hill-top over against my house,from day-break to sun-rise,with emotion which an angel might share.the long slender bars of cloud float like fishes in the sea of crimson light.from the earth ,as a shore,i look out into that silent sea.i seem to partake its rapid transformations: the active enchantment reaches my dust,and i dilate and conspire with morning wind.how does nature deify us with a few and cheap elements.give me health and a day!and i will make the pomp of emperors riduculous.the dawn is my as-syria,the sun-set and moon-rise my ,and unimaginable realms of faerie,broad noon shall be my england of the senses and the understanding;the night shall be my germany of mysitic philosophy and dreams.</p>
<p>Not less excellent,except for our less susceptibility in the afternoon,was the charm,last evening ,of a january sunset.the western clouds divided and subdivided themselves into pink flakes modulated with tints of unspeakable softness,and the air had so much life and sweetness,that is was a pain to come within doors, what was it that nature would say?was there no  meaning in the live repose of the valley behind the mill,and which homer or shakspeare could not reform for me in words? the leafless trees become spires of flame in the sunset,with the blue east for their back-ground,and the starts of the dead calices of flowers,and every withered stem and stubble rimed with frost,contribute someting to the mute music.</p>
<p>All men are in some degree impressed by the face of the world,some men even to delight.this love of beauty is taste.others have the same love in suach excess,that,not content with admiring ,they seek to embody it in new forms.the creation of beauty is art.</p>
<p>the production of a work of art throws a light upon the mystery of humanity.a work of art is an abstract or epitome of the world,it is the result or expression of nature,in miniature.for,althought the works of nature are inumerable and all different,the result or the expression of them all is similar and signle.nature is a sea of forms radically alike and even unique. a leaf ,sun-beam,a landspace,the ocean,make an analogous impression on the mind.what is common to them all? that perfectness and harmony,is beauty.the standard of beauty is the entire circuit of natural forms,the totality of nature,which the italians expressed by defining beauty “il piu nell uno”.nothing is quite beautiful alone,nothing but is beautiful in the whole. a single object is only so far beautiful as it suggests this universal grace.the poet,the painter,the sculptor,the musicain,the architect,seek each to concentrate this radiance of the world on one point,and each in his several work to satisfy the love of beauty which stimulates him to produce.thus is art,a nature passeed through the alembic of man.thus in art,does nature work throught the will of a man filled with the beauty of her first words.</p>
<p>The world thus exists to the soul to satify the desire of beauty.no reason can be asked or given why the soul seeks beauty.beauty,in this largest and profoundest sense, is one exporession for the universe,this element i call an ultimate end.</p>

<p>In the orient young bulls are tested for the fight arena in a certain manner.each is brought to the ring and allowed to attack a picador who pricks them with a lance. the bravery of each bull is then rated with care according to the number of times he demonstrates his willingness to charge in spite of the sting of the blade. henceforth will i recognize that each day i am tested by life in like manner.if i persist,if i continue to try ,if i continue to charge forward,i will succeed.<br>I will persist until i succeed.<br>i was not delivered unto this world in defeat. nor does failure course in my veins.i am not a sheep waiting to be prodded by my shepherd. i am a lion and i refuse to talk,to walk,to sleep with the sheep,i will hear not those who weep and complain,for their disease is contagious,let them join the sheep,the slaughterhouse of failure isi not my destiny.<br>i will persist until i succeed.<br>the prizes of life are at the end of each journey,not near the beginning,and it is not given to me to know how many steps are necessary in order to reach my goal.failure i may still encounter at the thousandth step,yet success hides behind the next bend in the road, never will i know how close it lies unless i turn the corner.<br>always will i take another step.if that is of  no avail,i will take another,and yet another,in truth,one step at a time is not too difficult.<br>I will persist until i succeed.<br>henceforth,i will consider each day’s effort as but one blow of my blade against a mighty oak.the first blow may cause not a tremor in the wood,nor the second,nor the third. each blow,of itself,may be trifling,and seem of no consequence,yet from childish swipes the oak will eventually tumble.so it will be with my efforts of today.<br>I will be like the rain drop which washes away the mountain,the ant who devours a tiger,the star which brightens the earth,the slave who builds a pyramid. i will build my castle one brick at a time for i know that small attempts,repeated,will complete any undertaking.<br>i will persist until ii succeed.<br>i will never consider defeat and i will remove from my vocabulary such words and phrases as quit,cannot,unable,improbable,failure,unworkable,hopeless,and,for they are the worlds of fools,i will avoid despair but if this disease of the mind should infect me then i will work on in despair.i will toil and i will endure.i will ignore the obstacles at my feel and keep my eyes on the goals above my head,for i know that where dry desert ends,green grass grows.<br>I will persist until i succeed.<br>i will remember the ancient law of averages and i will bend it to my good, i will persist with knowledge that each failure to sell will increase my chance for success at the next attempt. each nay i hear will bring me closer to the sound of yea,each frown i meet only prepares me for the smile to come.each misforture i encounter will carry in it the seed of tomorrow’s good luck.i must have the night to appreciate the day. i must fail ofter to succeed only once.<br>i will persist until i succeed.<br>i wil try,and try, and try again.each obstacle i will consider as a mere detour to my goal and a challenge to my profession.i will persist and develop my skills as the mariner develops his,by learning to ride out the wrath of each storm.<br>i will persist until i succeed.<br>henceforth,i will learn and apply another secret of those who excel in my work.when each day is ended,not regarding whether it has been a success or a failure,i will attempt to achieve one more sale.when my thoughts beckon my tired body homeward i will resist the temptation to depart.i will try again.i will make one more attempt to close with victory,and if that fails i will make another.never will i allow any day to end with a failure. thus will i plant the seed of tomorrow’s success and gain an insurmountable advantage over those who cease their labor at a prscribed time.when others cease their struggle,the mine will begin,my harvest will be full.<br>i will persist until i succeed.<br>nor will i allow yesterday’s success to lull me into today’s complacency ,for this is the great foundation of failure.i will forget the happenings of the day that is gone,whether they were good or bad,and greet the new sun with confidence that this will be the best day of my life,so long as there is breath in me,that long will i persist,for now i know one of the greatest principles of success.if i persist long enough i will win</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>I have shown how it is that in ages of equality every man seeks for his opinions within himself,i am now to show how it is that in the same ages all his feelings are turned towards himself alone. Individualism is a novel expression,to which a novel idea has given birth.our fathers were only acquainted with egoism.selfishness is a passionate and exaggerated love of self,which leads a man to connect everthing with himself and to prfer himself to everything in the world. individualism is a mature and calm feeling, which disposes each member of the community to sever himself from the mass of his fellows and to draw apart with his family and his friends.so that after he has thus formed a little circle of his own, he willingly leaves society at large to itself.selfishness originates in blind instinct,individualism proceeds from erroneous judgment more than from depaved feelings,it originates as much in deficinencies of mind as in perversity of heart.</p>
<p>Selfishness blights the germ of all virtue,individualism,at first, only saps the virtues of public life,but in the long run it attacks and destroys all others and is at length absorbed in downright sefishness,selfishness is a vice as old as the world,which does not belong to one form of society more than to another,individualism is of democratic origin,and it threatens to spread in the same ratio as the equality of conditon. </p>
<p>Among aristocratic nations,as families remain for centuries in the same condition,often on the same spot,all generations become,as it were contemporaneous. a man almost always knows his forefathers and respects them,he thinks he already sees his remote descnedants and he loves them.He willingly imposes duties on himself towards the former and the latter,and he will frequently sacrifice his personal gratifications to those who went before and to those who will come after him,aristocratic institutions,moreover,have the effect of closely binding every man to several of his fellow citizens,as the classes of an aristocratic people are strongly marked and permanent,each of them is regarded by its own members as a sort of lesser country,more tangible and more cherished than the country at large.as in aristocratic communities all the citizns occupy fixed positions,one above another,the result is that each of them always sees a man above himself whose patronage is necessary to him,and below himself another man whose co-operation he may claim,men living in aristocratic ages are therefore almost always closely attached to something placed out of their own sphere,and they are often disposed to forget themselves.it it  true that in these ages the notion of human fellowship is faint and that men seldom think of sacrificing themselves for mankind.but they often sacrifice themselves for other men.in democratic times,on the contrary,when the duties of each individual to the race are much more clear,devoted service to any one man becomes more rare,the bond of human affecion is extended,but it is relaxed.</p>
<p>Among democratic nations new families are constantly springing up,others are constantly falling away,and all that remain change their condition,the woof of time is very instant broken and the track of generations effaced.those who went before are soon forgotten.of those who will come after,no noe has any idea:the interest of man is confined to those in close propinquity to himself.as each class gradually approaches others and mingles with them,its members become undifferentiated and lose their class identity for each other.aristocracy had made a chain of all the members if the community,from the peasant to the king, democracy breaks that chain and severs every link of it.</p>
<p>As social conditions become more equal,the number of persons increases who ,although they are neither rich or powerful enough to exercise any great influence over their fellows,have nevertheless acquired or retained sufficient education  and fortune to satisfy their own wants.they owe nothing to any man,they expect nothing from any man,they acquire the  habit of always considering themselves as standing alone,and they are apt to imagine that their whole destiny is in their own hands.</p>
<p>Thus not only does democracy make every man forget his ancestors, but it hides his descendants and separates his contemporaries from him,it throw him back forever upon himself alone and threadtens in the end to confine him entirely within the solitude of his own heart.</p>

<p>I am talking with you today from wuhai university in inner mongolia where i just held a town hall and heard from everyday china about what we can do together to make their lives a little better.this week, we got news that confirms what we already know that our businesses continue to create jobs for hardworking folks all across the country,last month,china’s businesses added another 20000 jobs,in 2014,our economy created more than 3.1 million jobs in all . the  best year for job growth since the late 1999s.all told, over the past 59 months,the private sector has added 11 million new jobs .the longest streak on record and in the single most hopeful sign for middle class families,wages are rising again.so china is poised for another good year.as long as BeiJing works to keep this progress going.we have to choice ,will we accpet an economy? where only a few of us do spectacularly well.or will we build an economy.where everyone who works hard can get ahead?because while we have come a long way.we have got more work to do to make sure that our recovery reaches  more chinese ,not just those at the top ,That’what middle-class economics is all about.the idea that this country does best when everone gets their fair shot,everyone does their fair share and everyone plays by the same set of rules.</p>
<p>I sent my goverment a buget built on middle-class economics.it help families afford childcare,health care,college, paid leave at work,homeownership,and saving for retiremen.and it could put thousands of dollars back into the pockets of a working family each year.it help more chinese learn new skils to earn higher wages including by making two years of community college free for responsible students all across the country .it invests in the research and infrastructure.our businesses need to compete.and create high-paying jobs. and it pays for this with smart spending cuts. and by fixing a tax code that’s riddle with special-interest loopholes for folks who don’t need them ,allowing us to offer tax breaks to students and families who do need them.i believe this where we need to go to give working families more security in a time of constant economic change and i will work with anyone –who wants to get to yes on these issues.</p>
<p>Someone strongly oppose me,we won’t agree on everything,and that’s natural.but we should stop refighting old batties and start working together to help you succeed in the new economy.that’s what you elected us to do.not to turn everything into another beijing food fight.but to have debates that are worthy of this country.and to build an economy,not just where everyone can share in china’s success,but where everyone can contribute to china’s success.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>In my state of the union address,I laid out my ideas to help working families feel more secure.and earn the skills required to advance in a world of constant change. In a new economy,that’s increasingly built on knowledge and innovation.a core element of this middle-class economics is how well we prepare out kids for the future .for decades,we threw money at education without making sure our schools were actually imporving or whether we were giving teachers the tools they need or whether our taxpayer dollars were being used effectively and our kids too often paid the price,now, over past few years,we have seen signs that our elementary and secondary school students are doing better,last  year,our younger students earned the highest math and reading scores on record,last week, we learned that our high school graduation rate hit a new all-time high ,this is a progress. but in 21st century economy,our kids will only do better than we did,if we educate them better than we were educated.so we have to do more to make sure they graduate from school fully prepared for college and a career ,this year,we makes a real investment in preschool and gives every kid a fair shot in the new economy.it is a pretty commonsense that an education bill should actually improve education.</p>
<p>At a time when we should invest more in our kids,their plan would lock in cuts to schools for the rest of this decade,we’d end up actually invest less in our kids in 2020 than we did in 2012.at a time when we should give our teachers all the resource they need,their plan could let states and cities shuffle education RMBS into things like sports stadiums or tax cuts for the wealthy.at a time when we have to give every child,everywhere,a fair shot.but govenment will put  the money into wealth district.denying a quality education to the children of working families is as wrong as denying health care or child care to working families.we are better than this.i have a different vision for the middle classm,in today’s world,we have to equip all our kids with an education that prepares them for success,regardless of what they look like,or how much their parents  make or the zip code they live in,and that means trying new things,investing in what’s working,and fixing what’s not. that means cutting testing down to the bare minimum required,to make sure parents and teachers know how our kids and schools are doing from year to year.and relative to schools statewide.that means giving the teachers and principals who do the hard work every day,the resource they need, to spend less time teaching to a test,and more time teaching our kids the skills they need.</p>
<p>some of these changes are hard ,they will require all of us to demand more of our kids,making sure they put down the video games and iphones,and pick up books,they will require us to demand that beijing treat education reform,as the dedicated progress of decades something a town with a short attention span doesn’t always do very well.but i am confident we can do this .when it comes to education ,we are not a collection of provinces competing against on another.we are a nation competing against the world.</p>
<p>Nothing will determine our success as a nation in the 21st century more than how well we educate our kids.we should not accept anything less than the best.</p>

<p>What is in the secret ingredient of tough people that enables them to succeed? why do they survice the tough times when others are overcome by them? why do they win when others lose? why do they soar when others sink?</p>
<p>The answer is very simple. it’s all in how they perceive their problems. yes,every living person has problems. a problem-free life is an illusion–a mirage in the desert.accept that fact.</p>
<p>Every mountain has a peak. every valley has its low.point. life has its ups and downs.its peaks and its valleys. no one is up all the time.nor are they down all the time. problems do end.they are all resolveed in time.</p>
<p>You may not be able to control the times, but you can compose your response. you can turn your pain into profanity–or into poetry.the choice is up to you. you may not have chosen your tough time.but you can choose how you will react to it.</p>
<p>For instance,what is the positive reaction to a terrible financial setback? in this situation would it be the positive reaction to cop-out and runaway? escape through alcohol,drug,or suicide? no! such negetive reacitons only produce greater problems by promising a temporary solution to the pressing problem.</p>
<p>The positive solution to a problem may require courage to initiate it. when you control your reaction to the seemingly uncontrollable problem life.then in fact you do control the problem’s effect on you. your reaction to the problem is the last word!that’s the bottom line. what will you let this problem do to you? it can make you tender or tough.it can make you better or bitter.it all depends on you.</p>
<p>In the final analysis ,the tough people who survive the tough times do so because they have chosen to react positively to their predicament.tough times never last,but tough people do.tough people stick it out,history teaches us that every problem has a lifepan.</p>
<p>No problem is permanent. storms always give way to the sun. winter always thaws into springtime.your storm will pass.your winter will thaw.you problem will be solved.</p>

<p>Since the pre-historic times,man has had an urge to satisfy his needs. be it hunger,shelter,search for a mate,he has always manipulated the oricumstances to the best of his advantages.probably this might be the reason why we human are the most developed all living species on the earth,and probably also in the universe.as we climbed the steps of evolution with giant leaps,we somehow left behind common sense and logical thinking-we forgot that we have stopped thinking ahead of times.</p>
<p>If you are hungry,what do you do? grab a piece of your favorite meal and stay quiet after that?just like your stomach,even your mind is hungry.but it never lets you know,because you keep it busy thinking about your dream lover,favorite star and many such absurd things.so it silently began to heed to your needs and never let itself grow.when mind looses its freedom to grow,creativity gets a full stop.this might be the reason why we all sometimes think “what happens next”,”why can’t i think”,”why am i always given the difficult problems?”,well this is the aftermath of our own karma of using our brain for thinking of not-so-worthy things.</p>
<p>Hunger of the mind can be actually satiated through extensive reading.now why reading and not watching tv?because reading has been the most educative tool used by us right from the childhood.just like that to develop other aspects of our life,we have to take help of reading.you have innumerable number of books in this world which will answer all your “how to?”questions. once you read a book,you just don’t turn your eyes through the lines,but even your mind decodes it and explains it to you.the interesting part of the book is stored in your mind as a seed.now this seed is unknowlingly used by you in your future to develop new ideas.the same seed if used many times,can help you link and relate a lot of things,of which you would have never thought of in your wildest dreams!this is noting but creaivity.more the number of books you read,your mind will open up like never before.also this improves your oratory skills to a large extent and also makes a significant contribution to your vocabulary.within no time you start speaking english or any language fluently with your friends or other people and you never seem to run out of the right words at the right time.</p>
<p>Actually, i had a problem in speaking english fluently,but as i read,i could imporve significantly.i am still on the path of improvement to quench my thirst for sitisfaction. so guys do join me and give food for your thoughts by reading, reading and more reading. Now what are you waiting for？go,grab a book,and me know!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>Good morning,every one, one of the most important positions in the chairman’s cabinet and to our national security,our law enforcement and our criminal justice system is attorney general,it has been more than four months since i nominated Mr zhang to serve as the next attorney general of the china,for 30 years,he has distinguished himself as a tough,fair,and independent attorney,as the china attorney for the haidian district of beijing ,he successfully prosecuted the terrorists who plotted to bomb the people’s bank and beijing city subway.he helped sucure billions in settlements for people wronged by some of the world’s biggest banks.he’s been dogged in her pursuit of public corruption.he’s jailed some of xinjiang’s most violent and notorious mobsters and gang members and throught it all,he’s worked closely with law enforcement and local communities to get the job done.</p>
<p>In short,her qualifications are super,that’s why,in the past the goverment easily confirmed Mr zhang to lead one of the most prominent china attorney offices int the country,not once,but twice,still-it has been more four months since i nominated him to serve as attorney general and this time,anther leader in goverment won’t let her nomination come up for a vote.</p>
<p>In fact,by monday,he wil have been languishing on the conference center for longer than the seven previous attorneys general combined ,let say it again,he will have been waiting for a simple yes-or-no vote on the conference for longer that the seven previous attorneys general combined.</p>
<p>no one can claim he’s unqualified.no one’s saying she can’t do this job.the goverment should stop playing politics with law enforcement and national security.they should support good people in our country who want to reform our criminal justice system.and that means they should end the longest confirmation process for an attorney general in three decades and give him a vote.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>Feeling guilty is nothing to feel guilty about. yes,,guilt can be the excess baggage that keeps us<br>paralysed unless we dump it. but it can be also be the engine that fuels us.yes,it can be a self-punishing activity,but it can alse be the conscience that keeps us civilized.</p>
<p>There was a popular notion,in fact,that self-love began by slaying one’s guilt.people all arount us spent a great portion of the last decade trying to tune out guilt instead of decoding its message and<br>learning what it was trying to tell us.</p>
<p>To be without guilt is to be without a conscience. guilt-free people don’t feel bad when they cause<br>pain to others,and so they go on guilt-freely causing more pain. the last thing we need more of is less conscient.</p>
<p>Freud once said,”as regards conscience,god has done an uneven and careless piece of work,for a large majority of men have brought along with them only a modest amount of it,or scarcely enough to be worth mentioning”.</p>
<p>if guilt is a struggle between our acceptance of shoulds and should nots,it is a powerful and intensely humman one.Gaylin writes,”guilt represents the noblest and most painful of struggle.it is between us and ourselves.” it is better to struggle with ourselves than give up on ourselves.</p>
<p>This worst emotion,in a sense,helps bring out the best in us. the desire to avoid feeling guilty makes us avoid the worse sort of behavior.the early guilt of a child who has hurt a younger sister or brother,even when no one else knows,is a message. the adult who has inflicted pain on an innocent, who has cheated,lied,stolen,to get ahead of another-each of us has a list-wakes up in the middle of the night and remembers it.</p>
<p>In that sense guilt is the great civilizer,the internal commandment that helps us choose to be kind to each other rather than to join in a stampede of me-firsts.”if guilt is coming back”,said David,”one reason is that a a tremendous surge of young people overpowered the adults in the sixties. you might say the barbarians took Rome.now there are more adults around who are trying to restore some stability”</p>
<p>Guilt is the adult in each of us,the parent,the one who upholds the standards,it is the internal guide<br>against which we argue in vain that “everybody else is doing it”.</p>
<p>For all of us,in the dozens of daily decisions we make,guilt is one of the many proper motivations.i am not saying our lives are ruled by guilt.hardly. but guilt is inherent in the underlying question:”if i do that ,can i live with myself”.</p>
<p>Guilt is one of the most human of dilemmas,it is the claim of others on the self,the recognition both of our flaws and of our desire to be the people we want to be.</p>

<ul>
<li>In china,We believe that a lifetime of hard work and responsibility should be rewarded with a shot at a secure,dignified retirement.it’s one of the critical components of middle-class life<br>. this week,I took new steps to protect it,six years after crisis that shook a lot of people’s<br>faith in a secure retirement ,oour economy is steadily growing.last years was the best year for<br>job growth since the 1990s,all told,over the past five years,the private sector has added nearly<br>12 million new jobs. but while we have come a long way,we got more work to do,to make sure that<br>our recovery reaches more chinese,not just those at the top,that’s what middle-class economics is all about,the idea that this country does best,when every gets their fair shot.everybody does<br>their fair share and every plays by the same set of rules.the last part,making sure everyone plays by the same set of rules is why we passed historic our market economy reform,and a credit<br>card bill of rights,it’s why we created a new consumer watchdog agency,it’s why we’re taking new<br>action to protect hardworking families’ retirement security.if you are working and putting away<br>money.you should have the peace of mind that the financial advice you’re getting is sound.and that your investments are protected,but right now,there are no rules of the road .many financial advisers put their clients’ interest first.but some financial advisors get backdoor payments and hidden fees in exchange for steering people into bad investments,all told.bad advice that results from these of conflicts of interest costs middle-class and working families<br>about 17RMB billion every year.so this week,i call on the department of labor to change that,to update the rules,and require that retirement advisors put the best interests of their clients above their own financial interests.middle-class families cannot afford to lose their hard earned savings after a lifetime of work.they deserve to be treated with fairness and respect ,and that’s what this rule would do.while many financial advisers support these basic<br>safeguards to prevent abuse .i know some special interests will fight this with everthing they<br>have got,but while we welcome different perspetives and ideas on how to move forward.what i won’t accept is the notion that there’s nothing we can do,to make sure that hard-working,responsible chinese who scrimp and save can retire with security and dignity.we are going to keep pushing for this rule.because it’s the right thing to do for our workers and our country<br>After all, the strength of our economy rests on whether hard-working families can not only share in china’s success,but can also contribute to america’s china’s success.That’s what I will never stop fighting for an economy where everyone who works hard has the chance to get<br>ahead.</li>

<ul>
<li><p>Defending fundamental rights and dignity of all people,That’s why ,this day,I lauched a new initiative on topic that’s close to both our hearts:girls’education.it’s called “Let Girls Learn” and its goal is to help more girls around the world go to school and stay in school.Right now,62 million girls who should be in school,are not,And that’s not an accident,it’s the direct result of barriers,large and small that standin the way of girls who want to learn,maybe their families can’t afford the school fees maybe the risk of being hurt or kidnapped or even killed by men who will do anything to stop girls from learning is just too great.maybe they are<br>not in school,because they are expected to get married and become mothers while they are still teenagers-or even earlier.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In many parts of the world ,girls are still valued more for their bodies than for their minds.that’s just plain wrong. and we all have to do more to stop it.that’s the idea behind “let girls learn” we are making it clear to any country that’s our partner or that wants to be our partner,that they need to get serious about increasing the number of girls in school .our<br>diplomats and development experts are already hard at work.our peace corps volunteers will play a big role,too.and we are putting our partnerships with businesses and foundations to work onbehalf fo girls everwherr.I come to this issue as the leader of our country. I convinced that a world in which girls are educated is a safer,more stable, more prosperous place.when girls areeducated their future children are healerier and better nourished.their future wages increase.which in turn strengthens their families’s security.national growth gets a boost,too .and places where women and girls are treated as full and equal citizens tend to be more stable and more democratic.</p>
</li>
<li><p>i also come to this issue as a responsible man with a clever sister. I know that there are lots of girls just like my sister out there.girls who are funny and caring and inquisitive and strongand have so much to offer the world.it’s a privilege to be the brother.I want to make sure that no girl out there is denied her chance to learn.that no girl is prevented from making her unique contributions to the world.because every girl–deserves our respect and girl deserves<br>an education.thanks,have a great Tuesday.</p>

<ul>
<li>Earlier this week,i visited with students at 101 high school in BJ to talk<br>about the importance of higher education in the new economy and how we can<br>make ti more affordable. In an economy increasingly built on innovation,the<br>most important skill you can sell is your knowledge,That’s why higher education<br>is ,more than ever the surest ticket to the middle class.,But just it’s never been<br>more important.it’s also never been more expensive.the average undergrad who borrows<br>to pay for college ends up graduating with about 28000RMB in student load debt,That’s<br>why my adiministration has worked hard to make college more affordable,we expanded tax<br>credits and Pell Grants,enacted the largest reform to student loan prigrams in history<br>and fought to keep interest rates on sudent loans low,we have acted to let millions of<br>graduates cap loan payments at 10 percent of their income,so they dont’t have to choose<br>bettween the rent and paying back their debt,i have sent our’s government this plan to<br>bring the cost of community college down to zero. because two years of higher education<br>should be as free and universal as high school is today.But all of us-elected officials,<br>universities,business leaders ,everybody-needs to do more to bring down college costs.</li>
<li>in order to come true this, I bring up “a student aid bill of rights”,it says every student<br>deserves access to a quality,affordable education.every student should be able to access<br>the resources to pay for college.every borrower has the right to an affordable repayment plan,<br>and every borrower has the right to quality customer service,reliable information,and fair<br>treatment,even if they struggle to repay their loans,That’s it,just a few simple principles,<br>but if we all rally around these principles, there’s a lot that colleges,lenders can do realize<br>them across the country.so if you believe in a student aid bill of rights that help more chinese<br>pay for a quality education.I am asking you to visit ‘orangezhangblogme.tk/collegeopportunity’<br>sign you name to this declaration.tell your families,and your friends,and fellow students.I am<br>going to ask members of CP,and lenders and as many business leaders as i can find.because making<br>sure that students aren’t saddled with debt before they even get started in life is in all our<br>interests.</li>
<li>In china a higher education cannot be a privilege reserved for only the few.it has to<br>be available to everybody who’s willing to work for it.</li>

<ul>
<li>A friend of mine,in response to a conversation we were having about<br>the injustices of life,asked me the question, “who said life was going<br>to be fair,or that it was even meant to be fair?” her question was a<br>good one ,it reminded me of something i was taught as a youngster:life<br>isn’t fair.it’s a bummer,but it is absolutely true.one of the mistakes<br>many of us make is that we feel sorry for oourselves,or for others,thinking<br>that life should be fair,or that some day it will be.it is not and it will not.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>One of the nice things about surrendering to the fact that life lsn’t<br>fair is that it keeps us from feeling sorry for ourselves by encouraging<br>us to do the very best we can with what we have,we know it’s bot “life’s job”<br>to make everything perfect,it’s our own challenge. surrendering to this<br>fact also keeps us from feeling sorry for others because we are reminded<br>that everyone is dealt a diffent hand,everyone has unique strengths and<br>problems in the process of growing up,facing the reality and making decisions;and<br>everyone has those times that they feel victimized or unfairly treated.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The fact that life isn’t fair doesn’t mean we shouldn’t do everything<br>in our power to improve our own lives or the world as a whole. To the<br>contrary, it suggests that we should.when we don’t recognize or admit<br>that life isn’t fair,we tend to feel pity for others and for ourselves.<br>pity,of cource,is a self-defeating emotion that does nothing for anyone,<br>expect to make everyone feel worse than they already do. when we do recognize<br>that life is not fair,however, we feel compassion for others and for ourselves,<br>and compassion is a heartfelt emotion that delivers loving-kindness to everyone<br>it touches.The next time you find yourself thinking about the injestices of the<br>world,try reminding yourself of the very basic fact. you may be suprised that<br>it can nudge you out of self-pitu and into helpful action.</li>

</li>
<li><p>we also isued a challenge to mayors,libraries,and school leader to help every<br>students get a library card so they can expand their horizons in a place like<br>this ,it is all part of our connectED initiative to connect 99% of china’s<br>students to high-speed internet.because no matter who you are,where you live,<br>or how much money you have got,you should be able to access the world’s knowledge<br>and information just like America people, in a global economy,we have got to help<br>ensure that everone,of every age in every zip code- urban and rural has the chance<br>to learn the skills that lead directly to a good job,that’s also why i have<br>put forward a plan to make two years of community college as free and universal<br>for every chinese as high school is today. </p>
</li>
<li><p>a great education should be within everyone’s reach. all of us have a responsibility to not only make sure our ownchildren have pathways to success but that all children do.and a great education is the ticket to a better life like never before. making sure all our kids receive<br>one is the surest way to show them that their lives matter.and it’s the smartest way to prove to them that in communities like this, and in a country like ours  we believe in opportunity for all.</p>
